## Welcome to my gitHub repository!

### :wave: Introduction 

My name is Martin Stancl and I currently work as SDET
I am trying to improve my coding style, knowledge and would also love to share some of it during the process  
Therefore I decided to create this repository!

### :computer: What you'll see here 

Since development of test automation frameworks is my biggest passion, that's what I'll be focusing on the most.
At the moment I specialize on Java, so all you'll see will be in Java for now.
I would like to go through :  

  - BDD API testing frameworks - :heavy_check_mark: done :heavy_check_mark:
  - Web application front-end automation frameworks using Selenium - :heavy_check_mark: done :heavy_check_mark:
  - Spring API testing frameworks - coming :eyes:
  - Simple Web application with SPRING based API's for testing of all the above - coming :eyes:
  


I will try to switch in between TestNG and JUnit for the test frameworks,  
most likely using Maven for all the projects and Spring-boot for creating demo applications for the API testing  
since its much easier to create my own demo test app rather then relying on some public API   
(which is usually restricted to some degree or can change frequently and I would like to avoid that)   
I also enjoy casual game development just to get a taste of something new. So far I've done Tetris and Asteroids,
so you can see some of it in the repositories as well. For those, i use LibGDX library.

Since I work for QA, I do not only test the API's from the functional point of view but also do performance testing
using JMeter. I will most likely want to explore this a bit more programatically to see if I can learn something new there,  
hoping to share this with you as well!

### :memo: Sharing knowledge
Please, since the reasons why I created this repository is not only to get better at coding but to also share some if it, don't be shy to:  

  - Remark, comment, ask questions (each repository has its own discussion)
  - Fork any repository you want and use it for your own projects
  - Message me anytime via my LinkedIn! 
  
These are very important for me during the learning process, because we are not able to learn without seeing our own mistakes
